SECTION 133.1: CHI-SQUARE UNIFORMITY TEST FOR
        RND FUNCTION.

THIS PROGRAM RUNS A SERIES OF 60 EXPERIMENTS OF 1040 SAMPLES
TO DETERMINE IF THE RANDOM NUMBERS ARE EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED
AMONG 21 EQUAL-SIZE INTERVALS BETWEEN 0 AND 1.  CHI-SQUARE
IS COMPUTED AND DISPLAYED FOR EACH OF THESE EXPERIMENTS.
EACH CHI-SQUARE RESULT IS CATEGORIZED ACCORDING TO THE
PERCENTILE RANGE INTO WHICH ITS VALUE FALLS:

CATEGORY     % RANGE                CATEGORY    % RANGE
    1          0-1                      6        50-75
    2          1-5                      7        75-90
    3          5-10                     8        90-95
    4         10-25                     9        95-99
    5         25-50                    10        99-100

THESE CATEGORICAL RESULTS ARE THEN EVALUATED AGAIN USING
CHI-SQUARE (THE FIRST AND LAST THREE CATEGORIES ARE EACH
CONSOLIDATED INTO ONE), AND IF THE DISTRIBUTION AMONG
CATEGORIES IS SUFFICIENTLY IMPROBABLE (TOP OR BOTTOM 5%),
THE TEST FAILS.

WILL CONSOLIDATE CATEGORIES 1-3 AND 8-10, SO THAT
EXPECTED VALUE IN EACH IS >= 5, AS REQUIRED BY
CHI-SQUARE TEST.

FOR FIVE D.F., SHOULD HAVE 1.145476 <= CHI-SQ <= 11.0705
(5% TAIL AT EACH END.)
