        EXP FUNCTION.
    ANSI STANDARD 8.5

SECTION 122.1: EXCEPTION - OVERFLOW ON VALUE OF
        EXP FUNCTION.

THE OBJECT OF THIS TEST IS TO SEE WHETHER THE PROCESSOR
RECOGNIZES AN EXCEPTION WHEN THE VALUE RETURNED
BY THE EXP FUNCTION EXCEEDS MACHINE INFINITY.

TO PASS THIS TEST:

    1) A MESSAGE IDENTIFYING THE EXCEPTION MUST BE
       DISPLAYED, AND

    2) THE PROGRAM MUST SUPPLY MACHINE INFINITY AND
       CONTINUE EXECUTION.

                               BEGIN TEST.

AS OVERFLOW, AND MACHINE INFINITY SUPPLIED; IF SO,
***  TEST PASSED  ***  OTHERWISE  ***  TEST FAILED  ***
