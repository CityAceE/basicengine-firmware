PROGRAM FILE 39: ACCURACY OF ADDITION
    ANSI STANDARD 7.2, 7.4, 7.6

*** NOTE: THIS PROGRAM MAKES USE OF 'READ' AND 'DATA'
    WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN TESTED. IF SUBSEQUENT TESTS SHOW
    THESE FEATURES TO BE INCORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED, THEN THE
    VALIDITY OF THE RESULTS OF THIS TEST ROUTINE IS DOUBTFUL.

SECTION 39.1 ACCURACY OF ADDITION.

THIS SECTION TESTS THE ACCURACY OF ADDITION. THE COMPUTED
RESULT IS COMPARED WITH A RANGE ESTABLISHED BY PERTURBING
EACH OPERAND BY 1 IN ITS 6TH DIGIT. THE RESULT PASSES IF
IT FALLS WITHIN THE EXTREME VALUES GENERATED BY THIS
PERTURBATION (ACCURATE TO SIX DIGITS).

THIS TEST IS INFORMATIVE ONLY, SINCE THE ANSI STANDARD
DOES NOT MANDATE ANY ACCURACY FOR NUMERIC EXPRESSIONS.
