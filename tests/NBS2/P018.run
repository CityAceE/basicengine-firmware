PROGRAM FILE 18: THE IF-THEN STATEMENT WITH STRING OPERANDS.
    ANSI STANDARD 10.2, 10.4

SECTION 18.1: THE IF-THEN STATEMENT WITH STRING OPERANDS.

THIS SECTION TESTS THE COMPARISON OF STRING VARIABLES AND
CONSTANTS WITH A VARIETY OF VALUES. BOTH RELATIONSHIPS
(= AND <>) ARE TESTED FOR EACH PAIR OF VALUES. THE 'V' OR
'C' FOLLOWING THE COMPARAND VALUE INDICATES WHETHER IT IS
A VARIABLE OR A CONSTANTS.

'T' OR 'F' IS PRINTED TO SHOW THE OUTCOME OF THE
COMPARISON. FOR INCORRECT COMPARES, AN '*' IS PRINTED
NEXT TO THE ERRONEOUS RESULT.  WHEN DISPLAYING COMPARAND
VALUES, THE UNDERLINE CHARACTER, '_', IS USED TO REPRESENT
THE SPACE CHARACTER (THUS A DISPLAYED 'ONE_BLANK' 
INDICATES AN INTERNAL VALUE OF 'ONE BLANK').
ALSO, THE NULL STRING (LENGTH OF ZERO) IS DENOTED BY THE
LABEL '(NULL STRING)'.

CHARACTER STRINGS SHOULD TEST EQUAL IF AND ONLY IF THE
STRINGS ARE EQUAL IN LENGTH AND CONTAIN IDENTICAL SEQUENCES
OF CHARACTERS.

                  BEGIN TEST.
