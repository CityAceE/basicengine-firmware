PROGRAM FILE 31: EXCEPTION - ZERO RAISED TO A NEGATIVE POWER.
    ANSI STANDARD 7.5

SECTION 31.1: EXCEPTION - ZERO RAISED TO A NEGATIVE POWER.

TO PASS THIS TEST:

    1) A MESSAGE IDENTIFYING THE EXCEPTION MUST BE
       DISPLAYED, AND

    2) POSITIVE INFINITY MUST BE SUPPLIED AS THE VALUE
       OF THE EXPRESSION AND EXECUTION CONTINUES.

               BEGIN TEST

VALUE SUPPLIED = -inf

*** TEST FAILED: VALUE SUPPLIED LESS THAN MINIMUM
    POSITIVE MACHINE INFINITY. ***
Except that that is not how anything actually behaves:
- CBM BASIC: A = 0
- MSX BASIC: Division by zero
- C++: -inf
=> We go with C++, because that's consistent with
MSX BASIC when FP exceptions are enabled, and doesn't
require extra code.

                END TEST

END PROGRAM 31
