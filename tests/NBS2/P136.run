SECTION 136.1: GAP TEST FOR RND FUNCTION.

THIS PROGRAM TESTS THAT THE GAPS BETWEEN NUMBERS WITHIN
A SPECIFIED INTERVAL ARE DISTRIBUTED AS EXPECTED FOR
UNIFORMLY DISTRIBUTED RANDOM NUMBERS. CHI-SQUARE IS
COMPUTED AND DISPLAYED AS THE RESULT.

***** THIS TEST IS INFORMATIVE ONLY. *****

                    BEGIN TEST


WILL RUN 259 TRIALS, SO THAT EACH POSSIBILITY HAS
EXPECTED VALUE >= 10.


GAP SIZE	ACTUAL COUNT	EXPECTED COUNT

0	23	25.9
1	25	23.31
2	18	20.979
3	17	18.8811
4	14	16.99299

8	5	11.1491007
9	12	10.0341907
>=10	105	90.307716

FOR 10 D.F., SHOULD HAVE 3.9403 <= CHI-SQ <= 18.307
(5% TAIL AT EACH END.)

ACTUAL CHI-SQ = 8.32854886

*** INFORMATIVE TEST PASSED ***

                 END TEST
