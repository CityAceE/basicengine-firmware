PROGRAM FILE 88: THE ON-GOTO-STATEMENT.
    ANSI STANDARD 10.2, 10.4

SECTION 88.1: THE ON-GOTO EXPRESSION WITH INTEGER VALUES.

                               BEGIN TEST.


***  TEST PASSED  ***

                                 END TEST.


SECTION 88.2: THE ON-GOTO EXPRESSION WITH FRACTIONAL VALUES.

THIS SECTION TESTS THAT FRACTIONAL VALUES ARE ROUNDED
TO THE NEAREST INTEGER BY THE ON-GOTO BEFORE SELECTION
OF THE LINE-NUMBER FROM THE LIST.
WTF? We truncate, that's what MS BASIC does, too.

                               BEGIN TEST.

CONTROL FELL THROUGH ON-GOTO.
CONTROL FELL THROUGH ON-GOTO.
CONTROL WENT TO LINE #1 IN LIST, BUT ON-GOTO EXPRESSION = 2

***  TEST FAILED  ***

                                END TEST.

END PROGRAM 88
