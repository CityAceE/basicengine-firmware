   exits if the last 2 characters match, avoiding unnecessary calls to memcmp
   and allowing for a larger skip if there is no match.  A self-adapting
   filtering check is used to quickly detect mismatches in long needles.
   By limiting the needle length to 256, the shift table can be reduced to 8
   bits per entry, lowering preprocessing overhead and minimizing cache effects.
   The limit also implies worst-case performance is linear.

	 1) Is this safe?  Will it catch all the zero bytes?
	 Suppose there is a byte with all zeros.  Any carry bits
	 propagating from its left will fall into the hole at its
	 least significant bit and stop.  Since there will be no
	 carry from its most significant bit, the LSB of the
	 byte to the left will be unchanged, and the zero will be
	 detected.

	 2) Is this worthwhile?  Will it ignore everything except
	 zero bytes?  Suppose every byte of LONGWORD has a bit set
	 somewhere.  There will be a carry into bit 8.  If bit 8
	 is set, this will carry into bit 16.  If bit 8 is clear,
	 one of bits 9-15 must be set, so there will be a carry
	 into bit 16.  Similarly, there will be a carry into bit
	 24.  If one of bits 24-30 is set, there will be a carry
	 into bit 31, so all of the hole bits will be changed.

	 The one misfire occurs when bits 24-30 are clear and bit
	 31 is set; in this case, the hole at bit 31 is not
	 changed.  If we had access to the processor carry flag,
	 we could close this loophole by putting the fourth hole
	 at bit 32!

	 So it ignores everything except 128's, when they're aligned
	 properly.

	 3) But wait!  Aren't we looking for C, not zero?
	 Good point.  So what we do is XOR LONGWORD with a longword,
	 each of whose bytes is C.  This turns each byte that is C
	 into a zero.  */
